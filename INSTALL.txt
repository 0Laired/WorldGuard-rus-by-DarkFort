Installation
------------

Bukkit:

** Make sure you first install the WorldEdit plugin. **

  1. Create a "plugins" folder inside your server folder.

  2. Copy WorldGuard.jar into "plugins".
  
  3. Restart your server.

You may want to copy config.yml into plugins/WorldGuard/config.yml
(you will have to create that folder). Edit it to fit your needs.

hMod:

  1. Create a "plugins" folder inside your "bin" folder.

  2. Copy WorldGuard.jar into "plugins".

  3. Add "WorldGuard" to the "plugins" line of your server.properties file.
     If it's not already there, add the line. The line should look like this:
  
         plugins=WorldGuard
     
     If you have multiple plugins, separate plugin names with commas.
