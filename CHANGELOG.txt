1.2
- Sponge updated to remove water when the sponge block is set. Sponge radius
    can now be controlled using the 'sponge-radius' parameter and the
    default is now set to simulate Classic.
- Updated for a newer build of "b126," meaning that lava spread control
    now works well!
- A new summary of the status of some core protections is now printed
    on start. Disable this with 'summary-on-start'.
- Blacklist system has been overhauled. Check README.txt for changed
    configuration settings!
- The blacklist's method of preventing notification repeats is now better,
    instead waiting 3 seconds before notifying again (before it didn't
    notify again at all unless the user started using another blocked
    action).
- To give users the ability to receive notifications, the command to give
    permission to has been changed to /worldguardnotify, although the
    old one (that was never mentioned anywhere) still works.
- Water and lava buckets are now psuedo-blocked using an unreliable
    method that risks the stability of your server (no other plugin
    does it better though). Use it as your own risk.
- Added on item drop and on item use (i.e. chest) events.
- Chests, signs, and furnaces can now be blocked better with the
    blacklist system.
- The event names in the blacklist configuration have changed but the old
    event names should still work. The new names should make "more sense."
- A new "ban" action has been added to the blacklist.
- Action messages have been improved, now longer saying "destroyed"
    for everything.
- Logging to file has been completely changed, allowing you to use
    the date and time and the player's username in the log filename. It
    no longer rotates log files based on size, however.
- Logging to database is now supported.
- Tools can now be destroyed on drop to alleviate the durability cheat.
    You can do this with either with the blacklist or with the
    'item-drop-blacklist' configuration option. The configuration option
    prints more friendly messages than the 'tell' action of blacklists.
