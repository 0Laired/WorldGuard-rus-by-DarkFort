1.4
- New on-acquire hook. This does both a total inventory check on inventory
    change and item pick up denial. The item pick up denial is largely
    thanks to Dinnerbone for fulfilling my request to add a particular hook.
- Item durability can now be toggled with item-durability. Thanks to
    Dinnerbone for figuring this out while filfilling my request. The
    default setting is to fix item durability.
- New no-physics-gravel and no-physics-sand options allow you to
    prevent gravel and sand from falling.
- New allow-portal-anywhere option allows you to create portal blocks
    anywhere.
    
1.3
- UPGRADE WARNING: If you are using database logging, you must add a
    NULL 'comment' VARCHAR field to the table. The line of SQL that you
    can run for MySQL can be found in blacklist_table.sql.
- Improved plugin compatibility with the block lag fix. For maximum
    compatibility, you must now list WorldGuard as the first plugin in
    server.properties and you cannot reload or enable the plugin
    while the server is up. This is for bad plugins that unnecessarily
    use the "critical" priority for its hooks like the LWC. Most plugins
    don't do that though, so this won't apply for most people.
- Fixed signs being blank if they were denied via the blacklist.
- Added on-break event to the blacklist.
- Added comments and messages. Comments are only for your own use and they
    are printed with the log and notify actions of the blacklist. The
    message replaces the message that is shown the user and it is optional.
- The blacklist notification messages are now more compact and are
    light grey instead of light purple.
- The notify, log, and tell actions will now trigger every time for the
    on-break, on-create, on-drop events rather than wait 3 seconds between
    events for the same item or block for a player.

1.2
- /stopfire and /allowfire disable and enable fire spreading globally.
- Block lag fix slightly improved in accuracy for item drops.
- Sponge updated to remove water when the sponge block is set. Sponge radius
    can now be controlled using the 'sponge-radius' parameter and the
    default is now set to simulate Classic.
- Updated for a newer build of "b126," meaning that lava spread control
    now works well!
- A new summary of the status of some core protections is now printed
    on start. Disable this with 'summary-on-start'.
- Blacklist system has been overhauled. Check README.txt for changed
    configuration settings!
- The blacklist's method of preventing notification repeats is now better,
    instead waiting 3 seconds before notifying again (before it didn't
    notify again at all unless the user started using another blocked
    action).
- To give users the ability to receive notifications, the command to give
    permission to has been changed to /worldguardnotify, although the
    old one (that was never mentioned anywhere) still works.
- Water and lava buckets are now psuedo-blocked using an unreliable
    method that risks the stability of your server (no other plugin
    does it better though). Use it as your own risk.
- Added on item drop and on item use (i.e. chest) events.
- Chests, signs, and furnaces can now be blocked better with the
    blacklist system.
- The event names in the blacklist configuration have changed but the old
    event names should still work. The new names should make "more sense."
- A new "ban" action has been added to the blacklist.
- Action messages have been improved, now longer saying "destroyed"
    for everything.
- Logging to file has been completely changed, allowing you to use
    the date and time and the player's username in the log filename. It
    no longer rotates log files based on size, however.
- Logging to database is now supported.
- Tools can now be destroyed on drop to alleviate the durability cheat.
    You can do this with either with the blacklist or with the
    'item-drop-blacklist' configuration option. The configuration option
    prints more friendly messages than the 'tell' action of blacklists.
