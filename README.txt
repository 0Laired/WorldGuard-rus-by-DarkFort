While I would like to thank everyone for their support, I would like to
say thanks to the following individuals for their direct
contributions to WorldGuard:

- Sturmeh, for contributing the original durability workaround
- Meaglin, for changing the on flow hook at my request
- Dinnerbone, for implementing the on item pick up hook at my request,
    and also for figuring out the durability bug in the process
