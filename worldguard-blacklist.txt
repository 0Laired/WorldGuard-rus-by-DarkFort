#
# This is the blacklist for WorldGuard. Comments start with # and they
# are ignored so you can put your own notes.
#
# Format:
# [item1,item2]
# option1=options
# event1=whatToDo1,whatToDo2,whatToDo3
# event2=whatToDo1,whatToDo2
#
# Example to block ore and catch some events:
# [coalore,goldore,ironore]
# on-destroy-with=deny,log,kick
# on-place=deny,tell
#
# Options:
# - ignore-groups (comma-delimited list of groups to not affect)
# - comment (message for yourself that is printed with 'log' and 'notify')
# - message (optional message to show the user instead; %s is the item name)
#
# Events:
# - on-destroy (when a block of this type is being destroyed)
# - on-break (when a block of this type is about to be broken)
# - on-destroy-with (the item/block held by the user while destroying)
# - on-place (a block is being placed)
# - on-use (an item like a lighter is being used)
# - on-right-click (the block is right clicked -- curently INEFFECTIVE)
# - on-drop (the item is being dropped from the player's inventory)
# - on-acquire (the item enters a player's inventory via some method)
#
# Actions (for events):
# - deny (deny completely)
# - notify (notify admins)
# - log (log to console/file/database)
# - tell (tell a player that that's not allowed)
# - kick (kick player)
# - ban (ban player)
#
# With the on-acquire event, it will completely block item pick ups
# (the item will still be on the ground) if you use 'deny' but the other
# actions (notify, log, etc.) won't do anything. However, if the player
# receives the item via a different method (i.e. from a chest), all actions
# will work although the item is removed after a short delay rather than
# blocked from the beginning (as it is part client-side).
#
# Users with the /worldguardnotify permission will be receive notifications.
#
# -------------
#
# You can have the same block or item used in two different sections and
# they will both apply:
#
# [goldblock]
# ignore-groups=vip
# on-destroy=deny
# [goldblock]
# ignore-groups=admins
# on-destroy=tell
#
# However, some events override others. For example, if you disable both
# usage of the diamond pickaxe (with the on-destroy-with event) and
# destruction of gold blocks (with the on-destroy event) and a player tries
# to destroy a gold block with a diamond pickaxe, because the
# on-destroy-with event comes first, the rules for the gold block
# will not be applied (but the player will be denied nevertheless).
#
# -------------
#
# Some examples follow. Remember to remove # in front if you want them
# to work for you!
